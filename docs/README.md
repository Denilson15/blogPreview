# Blog Preview Card

This is a custom-built blog preview card developed from scratch using **HTML** and **CSS**. While the project idea was inspired by Frontend Mentor's challenge, the entire design and codebase were independently created to practice building responsive web components and mastering layout techniques.

> 💡 No AI was used in the development of this project. AI tools were utilized solely for documentation purposes, such as generating this README. I believe in building a strong foundation in programming while also learning how to effectively use AI tools as part of a modern developer workflow.

## ✨ Overview

This project showcases a functional blog preview card that includes:

- A featured image representing the blog post
- A category label and publication date
- A blog post title and brief description
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices

## ⚙️ How It Works

- The HTML structure defines the layout of the blog preview card, including sections for the image, category, title, and description.
- CSS is used to style the card, including layout, colors, typography, and hover effects, ensuring a clean and professional appearance.
- The project is structured to be easily expandable for future development.

## 🛠️ Personalization

Although the initial concept was provided by Frontend Mentor, the following customizations were implemented:

- Designed and styled the layout from scratch using CSS
- Implemented responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across devices
- Structured the HTML for semantic clarity and accessibility

## 🚧 Planned Updates

- Add interactive elements such as hover effects on the card
- Implement dark mode with CSS variables
- Enhance layout for tablet/desktop view

## 🗂️ File Structure (basic)
